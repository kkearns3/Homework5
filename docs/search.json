this is because describe() will take character columns and convert them to numeric values as 1, 2, 3, etc.\nFor the categorical variables (marked with asterisks in the above table), I used min and max values just to verify that the number of different values in that column make sense (i.e. for school, the min is 1 and the max is 2, indicating there are indeed 2 schools in the data set, as expected).\nFor numeric variables, I compared min and max with the range of values provided in the documentation. So for instance, age has min of 15 and max of 22, which is the same as the range provided by the authors of the study.\nOne set of values that struck me as odd were failures. Documentation states that the range is 1-4. However, in the combined data the min is 0 and the max is 3. I checked the counts for each value in the combined and the original data sets (see below), since I wondered if there were some in math or portuguese data sets that were lost after the inner join. However, there were no 4+ failures in any of them.\n\n\nstudent_combined |&gt;\n  group_by(failures) |&gt;\n  summarize(count = n())\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  failures count\n     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1        0   302\n2        1    14\n3        3     4\n\n\n\nstudent_mat |&gt;\n  group_by(failures) |&gt;\n  summarize(count = n())\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  failures count\n     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1        0   312\n2        1    50\n3        2    17\n4        3    16\n\n\n\nstudent_por |&gt;\n  group_by(failures) |&gt;\n  summarize(count = n())\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  failures count\n     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1        0   549\n2        1    70\n3        2    16\n4        3    14\n\n\n\nstr(student_combined)\n\ntibble [320 × 42] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ school      : chr [1:320] \"GP\" \"GP\" \"GP\" \"GP\" ...\n $ sex         : chr [1:320] \"F\" \"F\" \"F\" \"F\" ...\n $ age         : num [1:320] 18 17 15 16 16 16 17 15 15 15 ...\n $ address     : chr [1:320] \"U\" \"U\" \"U\" \"U\" ...\n $ famsize     : chr [1:320] \"GT3\" \"GT3\" \"GT3\" \"GT3\" ...\n $ Pstatus     : chr [1:320] \"A\" \"T\" \"T\" \"T\" ...\n $ Medu        : num [1:320] 4 1 4 3 4 2 4 3 3 4 ...\n $ Fedu        : num [1:320] 4 1 2 3 3 2 4 2 4 4 ...\n $ Mjob        : chr [1:320] \"at_home\" \"at_home\" \"health\" \"other\" ...\n $ Fjob        : chr [1:320] \"teacher\" \"other\" \"services\" \"other\" ...\n $ reason      : chr [1:320] \"course\" \"course\" \"home\" \"home\" ...\n $ guardian    : chr [1:320] \"mother\" \"father\" \"mother\" \"father\" ...\n $ traveltime  : num [1:320] 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 ...\n $ studytime   : num [1:320] 2 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ failures    : num [1:320] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ schoolsup   : chr [1:320] \"yes\" \"no\" \"no\" \"no\" ...\n $ famsup      : chr [1:320] \"no\" \"yes\" \"yes\" \"yes\" ...\n $ paid_mat    : chr [1:320] \"no\" \"no\" \"yes\" \"yes\" ...\n $ activities  : chr [1:320] \"no\" \"no\" \"yes\" \"no\" ...\n $ nursery     : chr [1:320] \"yes\" \"no\" \"yes\" \"yes\" ...\n $ higher      : chr [1:320] \"yes\" \"yes\" \"yes\" \"yes\" ...\n $ internet    : chr [1:320] \"no\" \"yes\" \"yes\" \"no\" ...\n $ romantic    : chr [1:320] \"no\" \"no\" \"yes\" \"no\" ...\n $ famrel      : num [1:320] 4 5 3 4 5 4 4 4 5 3 ...\n $ freetime    : num [1:320] 3 3 2 3 4 4 1 2 5 3 ...\n $ goout       : num [1:320] 4 3 2 2 2 4 4 2 1 3 ...\n $ Dalc        : num [1:320] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ Walc        : num [1:320] 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 ...\n $ health      : num [1:320] 3 3 5 5 5 3 1 1 5 2 ...\n $ absences_mat: num [1:320] 6 4 2 4 10 0 6 0 0 0 ...\n $ G1_mat      : num [1:320] 5 5 15 6 15 12 6 16 14 10 ...\n $ G2_mat      : num [1:320] 6 5 14 10 15 12 5 18 15 8 ...\n $ G3_mat      : num [1:320] 6 6 15 10 15 11 6 19 15 9 ...\n $ paid_por    : chr [1:320] \"no\" \"no\" \"no\" \"no\" ...\n $ absences_por: num [1:320] 4 2 0 0 6 0 2 0 0 2 ...\n $ G1_por      : num [1:320] 0 9 14 11 12 13 10 15 12 14 ...\n $ G2_por      : num [1:320] 11 11 14 13 12 12 13 16 12 14 ...\n $ G3_por      : num [1:320] 11 11 14 13 13 13 13 17 13 14 ...\n $ studytimeF  : Factor w/ 4 levels \"&lt;2 hours\",\"2 to 5 hours\",..: 2 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ schoolsupF  : Factor w/ 2 levels \"no\",\"yes\": 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 ...\n $ famsupF     : Factor w/ 2 levels \"no\",\"yes\": 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ addressF    : Factor w/ 2 levels \"Urban\",\"Rural\": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n\n\nDo the data types make sense?\n\n\nMedu and Fedu were both read in as numeric, but they are integer representations of education level, so we won’t need to do mathematical operations on them. Therefore, they can be recast as character.\ntraveltime and studytime should probably also be recast as character since they are really categorical, and the numbers represent time ranges rather than length of time.\nfailures should be changed to character, since even though n &lt; 4 is the actual number of failures, 4 is a catchall for anything more than 3 failures. Mathematical operations can be done if filtered on n &lt; 4, but it might be best to change it to character since just excluding a high number of failures might not have a lot of analytic value.\nThere are 10 variables that are just yes/no fields, so they are binary. Technically they can be stored as boolean, but they’ll be left as yes/no just because those values look nicer in tables and there’s not a chance of accidentally coercing them to numeric like there is with boolean.\nfamrel, freetime, goout, Dalc, Walc, and health are all ranked measures on a scale of 1 to 5. These will be stored as character.\n\n\n\nstudent_combined &lt;- student_combined |&gt;\n  mutate(Medu = as.character(Medu),\n         Fedu = as.character(Fedu),\n         traveltime = as.character(traveltime),\n         studytime = as.character(studytime),\n         failures = as.character(failures), \n         famrel = as.character(famrel),\n         freetime = as.character(freetime),\n         goout = as.character(goout),\n         Dalc = as.character(Dalc),\n         Walc = as.character(Walc),\n         health = as.character(health)\n         )"

Students may apply the same set of study skills across subjects, so that their scores would be related. It makes intuitive sense that the correlation of scores in different subjects would be less strong, since math and portuguese require differing sets of skills to perform well.

values with the documentation provided on the data download website.\nMain focus was ensuring the min and max values aligned with what the documentation says they should be, and for the most part they look as expected.\n\nFor numeric columns, I checked that the min and max were the same as the range stated for the column in the documentation\nFor categorical variables (marked with asterisks in the above table), the min and max “values” really just reflect how many unique values there are in the column, so I just made sure the max was the same as the number of possible values for that column\n\nDocumentation states that the range for the failures column is 1-4. However, in the combined data the min is 0 and the max is 3. I checked the counts for each value in the combined and the original data sets (see below), since I wondered if there were some in math or portuguese data sets that were lost after the inner join. However, there were no 4+ failures in any of them.\n\n\nstudent_combined |&gt;\n  group_by(failures) |&gt;\n  summarize(count = n())\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  failures count\n     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1        0   302\n2        1    14\n3        3     4\n\n\n\nstudent_mat |&gt;\n  group_by(failures) |&gt;\n  summarize(count = n())\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  failures count\n     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1        0   312\n2        1    50\n3        2    17\n4        3    16\n\n\n\nstudent_por |&gt;\n  group_by(failures) |&gt;\n  summarize(count = n())\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  failures count\n     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1        0   549\n2        1    70\n3        2    16\n4        3    14\n\n\n\nstr(student_combined)\n\ntibble [320 × 42] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ school      : chr [1:320] \"GP\" \"GP\" \"GP\" \"GP\" ...\n $ sex         : chr [1:320] \"F\" \"F\" \"F\" \"F\" ...\n $ age         : num [1:320] 18 17 15 16 16 16 17 15 15 15 ...\n $ address     : chr [1:320] \"U\" \"U\" \"U\" \"U\" ...\n $ famsize     : chr [1:320] \"GT3\" \"GT3\" \"GT3\" \"GT3\" ...\n $ Pstatus     : chr [1:320] \"A\" \"T\" \"T\" \"T\" ...\n $ Medu        : num [1:320] 4 1 4 3 4 2 4 3 3 4 ...\n $ Fedu        : num [1:320] 4 1 2 3 3 2 4 2 4 4 ...\n $ Mjob        : chr [1:320] \"at_home\" \"at_home\" \"health\" \"other\" ...\n $ Fjob        : chr [1:320] \"teacher\" \"other\" \"services\" \"other\" ...\n $ reason      : chr [1:320] \"course\" \"course\" \"home\" \"home\" ...\n $ guardian    : chr [1:320] \"mother\" \"father\" \"mother\" \"father\" ...\n $ traveltime  : num [1:320] 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 ...\n $ studytime   : num [1:320] 2 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ failures    : num [1:320] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ schoolsup   : chr [1:320] \"yes\" \"no\" \"no\" \"no\" ...\n $ famsup      : chr [1:320] \"no\" \"yes\" \"yes\" \"yes\" ...\n $ paid_mat    : chr [1:320] \"no\" \"no\" \"yes\" \"yes\" ...\n $ activities  : chr [1:320] \"no\" \"no\" \"yes\" \"no\" ...\n $ nursery     : chr [1:320] \"yes\" \"no\" \"yes\" \"yes\" ...\n $ higher      : chr [1:320] \"yes\" \"yes\" \"yes\" \"yes\" ...\n $ internet    : chr [1:320] \"no\" \"yes\" \"yes\" \"no\" ...\n $ romantic    : chr [1:320] \"no\" \"no\" \"yes\" \"no\" ...\n $ famrel      : num [1:320] 4 5 3 4 5 4 4 4 5 3 ...\n $ freetime    : num [1:320] 3 3 2 3 4 4 1 2 5 3 ...\n $ goout       : num [1:320] 4 3 2 2 2 4 4 2 1 3 ...\n $ Dalc        : num [1:320] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ Walc        : num [1:320] 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 ...\n $ health      : num [1:320] 3 3 5 5 5 3 1 1 5 2 ...\n $ absences_mat: num [1:320] 6 4 2 4 10 0 6 0 0 0 ...\n $ G1_mat      : num [1:320] 5 5 15 6 15 12 6 16 14 10 ...\n $ G2_mat      : num [1:320] 6 5 14 10 15 12 5 18 15 8 ...\n $ G3_mat      : num [1:320] 6 6 15 10 15 11 6 19 15 9 ...\n $ paid_por    : chr [1:320] \"no\" \"no\" \"no\" \"no\" ...\n $ absences_por: num [1:320] 4 2 0 0 6 0 2 0 0 2 ...\n $ G1_por      : num [1:320] 0 9 14 11 12 13 10 15 12 14 ...\n $ G2_por      : num [1:320] 11 11 14 13 12 12 13 16 12 14 ...\n $ G3_por      : num [1:320] 11 11 14 13 13 13 13 17 13 14 ...\n $ studytimeF  : Factor w/ 4 levels \"&lt;2 hours\",\"2 to 5 hours\",..: 2 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ schoolsupF  : Factor w/ 2 levels \"no\",\"yes\": 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 ...\n $ famsupF     : Factor w/ 2 levels \"no\",\"yes\": 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ addressF    : Factor w/ 2 levels \"Urban\",\"Rural\": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n\n\nDo the data types make sense?\n\nThere are a lot of variables in this data set that use numbers to code for values that are non-numeric. So even though R read them in as numeric, it is not meaningful to do mathematical operations on them, so they will be changed to character.\n\nInteger representations of education level (Medu, Fedu)\nTime ranges (traveltime, studytime)\nn &lt; 4 is an actual count, but n = 4 is a catchall value for n &gt;= 4 (failures). Mathematical operations can be done if filtered on n &lt; 4, but it might be best to change it to character since just excluding a high number of failures might not have a lot of analytic value.\nranked measures on a scale of 1 to 5 (famrel, freetime, goout, Dalc, Walc, health)\n\nThere are 10 variables that are just yes/no fields, so they are binary. Technically they can be stored as boolean, but they’ll be left as yes/no just because those values look nicer in tables and there’s not a chance of accidentally coercing them to numeric like there is with boolean.\n\n\nstudent_combined &lt;- student_combined |&gt;\n  mutate(Medu = as.character(Medu),\n         Fedu = as.character(Fedu),\n         traveltime = as.character(traveltime),\n         studytime = as.character(studytime),\n         failures = as.character(failures), \n         famrel = as.character(famrel),\n         freetime = as.character(freetime),\n         goout = as.character(goout),\n         Dalc = as.character(Dalc),\n         Walc = as.character(Walc),\n         health = as.character(health)\n         )"

Still see some increased benefit to studying 2-5 hours compared to &lt;2 hours for the urban group, no matter the family support status."
